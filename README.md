# Task5
 ### The server stores a number, which is initially 0.
    After connection, the current client sends some numbers, then the text "exit".
    For each number sent, the server adds the number to its internal counter,
    and sends the increased value back to the client.
    When the client exits, the server starts waiting for the next client.
